Blockchain for Transparency in Botswana's Diamond Supply Chain
Abstract: The global diamond industry faces a growing demand for transparency and ethical sourcing. Consumers are increasingly concerned about the origin of their diamonds, seeking assurances that they are not contributing to conflicts or human rights abuses. Botswana, a leading diamond producer with the well-established Debswana Diamond Pipeline, strives to balance security and revenue generation with ethical practices. However, limitations exist in the current system, including confidential contracts that restrict transparency in pricing and allocation, and dependence on a single marketing channel, De Beers, which limits control over diamond marketing and pricing. Furthermore, a significant portion of diamonds are cut and polished outside of Botswana, hindering local economic benefits.

This capstone project explores the potential of blockchain technology to address these challenges and propel Botswana's diamond industry towards a more transparent, secure, and sustainable future. By implementing a blockchain-based platform specifically designed for the Debswana Diamond Pipeline, the project aims to create an immutable record of diamond origin, ownership, and transactions. This will empower stakeholders across the supply chain, from miners to consumers, with greater visibility and trust. Additionally, the platform can promote ethical sourcing practices by providing consumers with verifiable data on diamond origin. Ultimately, this project seeks to leverage blockchain technology to enhance transparency, foster ethical practices, and increase local value addition within Botswana's diamond industry
